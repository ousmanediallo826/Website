                    <h2>Hydrogen production using photobiological methods</h2>
                    <p>Artificial photosynthesis as a chemical process replicates natural photosynthesis to reduce anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), increase fuel security, and provide a sustainable global economy (Faunce et al., 2013). Because of the
                        development of some suitable technologies, we can develop artificial photosynthesis using artificial leaves for the efficient conversion of solar energy into H2 and other fuels (Centi & Perathoner, 2010, 2011). Therefore, research
                        has been carried out to harvest solar energy to produce H2 by artificial photosynthesis (Lewis & Nocera, 2006; Nocera, 2009). </p>

                    <p>Artificial photosynthesis is recent technology, and is beginning to appear promising. Usually there is a light-reaction side, where sunlight is used, and a dark-reaction side. There are a couple of ways of achieving artificial photosynthesis
                        [7]: Fig. 21.7 shows one method. A multijunction semiconductor is used for the light-reaction side. Water changes to oxygen and hydrogen ions in the presence of sunlight. Electrons and hydrogen ions move to the dark-reaction side,
                        where gold nano-catalysts are used. Then, the hydrogen ion and CO2 change to carbon monoxide and water. Efficiency of conversion is defined by the following equation.</p>
                    <p>where G is the rate of substance generation by artificial photosynthesis, which is typically carbon monoxide, ΔGf0 is the difference of free energy between the generated substance and that of CO2. Q is the energy absorbed from sunshine
                        per unit area, and A is area.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col col-1 col-bg">


                    <p>Present efficiency of this conversion is about 1.5%. Another method is to use a gallium nitride semiconductor for the light-reaction side and to use a metallic catalyst, typically copper, for the dark-reaction side. In the light-reaction
                        side, water becomes oxygen and hydrogen ions with sunlight, and CO2 becomes methane in the dark-reaction side. The conversion rate of this process is about 0.2%. </p>

                    <h2>Bioenergy With Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS)</h2>
                    <p>Artificial photosynthesis, which is described as “Chemistry's Greatest Challenge,” attempts to replicate the natural processes of photosynthesis, and, at least in near future, the goal of artificial photosynthesis is to use sunlight
                        energy to make high-energy chemicals to store energy. A challenge in artificial photosynthesis is to use cheap and environmentally friendly compounds. Many components currently proposed for use in artificial photosynthetic systems
                        are expensive, toxic, inefficient, or nondurable.</p>

                    <p>An “artificial tree” is a device that mimics the processes used by biological plant life to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. In nature, plants combine CO2 from the atmosphere with water from their sap chemically, forming various hydro
                        and oxy-hydrocarbons. However, in the case of artificial trees, the output from the “tree” is a stream of essentially pure CO2 at high pressure, ready for sequestration.</p>
